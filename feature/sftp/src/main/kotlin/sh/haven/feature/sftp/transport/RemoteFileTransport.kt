/**
 * Abstraction over the SSH-backed file operations the SFTP screen needs.
 * Two implementations live alongside this interface:
 *  - [SftpTransport] — wraps JSch's ChannelSftp (the historical happy path)
 *  - [ScpTransport]  — speaks legacy SCP (scp -t / -f) over an exec channel
 *                       plus `ls -la` for directory listings
 *
 * The rclone / SMB / local backends in SftpViewModel don't use this
 * interface — they predate it and have different semantics. Only the SSH
 * code paths dispatch through here.
